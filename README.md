on 5ServoMotor 1 and 2 pictures :
all motors ground wires were connected to a single wire leading to GND outlet on the arduino 
and all motors power wires were connected to a single wire leading to 5v outlet on the arduino
and the motors signal wires were connected directly to the arduino on the outlet 3 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 11

on 5ServoMotorWithRheostat 1 , 2 and 3 pictures :
same work as above the difference is a Rheostat was added to the circle and its terminal 1 was connected to GND on the arduino and its terminal 2 was connected to 5v on the arduino and the wiper was connected to the A0 outlet on the arduino.
